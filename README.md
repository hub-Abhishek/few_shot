Deep learning has been a huge success in the previous decace. With advancements in computational power and a boom in 
data capturing techniques, we've seen networks and architectures constantly raising the bar in the realms of 
computer vision problems.  

However, these deep learning frameworks suffer from one significant flaw - these architectures are extremely data 
hungry require extensively high computation time and resources, either of which might not be available for a myriad 
of Furthermore, data collection, preprocessing and annotation are expensive tasks requiring dedicated process flows 
which can often take time to be implemented in a usable manner. 

Few shot learning is one of the solutions that can be used in these cases to tackle the problem of image 
classification. **FSL** is a form of meta learning which can be applied to cases where there is a limited amount of 
training samples with supervised information at hand. FSL that could drastically reduce the turnaround time of 
building machine learning applications as a low-cost solution in some of these cases.

In general, there are 4 sub classes of few shot learning - 
1. N-Shot Learning (NSL)
2. Few-Shot Learning
3. One-Shot Learning (OSL)
4. Less than one or Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL)
